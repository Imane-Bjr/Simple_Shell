## HSH: The Gates of Shell 
The gates of shell is an ALX group project in for the second month MONTH#2. This is one of the most anticipated project 
and also one that will challenge us a lot about everything we've learned so far:

* Basics of programming
* Basics of C
* Basics of thinking like an engineer
* Group work
* Learning how to learn

## Learning Goals

### Genreral

* Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
* Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
* Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
* Who is Ken Thompson
* How does a shell work
* What is a pid and a ppid
* How to manipulate the environment of the current process
* What is the difference between a function and a system call
* How to create processes
* What are the three prototypes of `main`
* How does the shell use the `PATH` to find the programs
* How to execute another program with the `execve` system call
* How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
* What is `EOF` / “end-of-file”?

## Requirements

### General

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* Your shell should not have any memory leaks
* No more than 5 functions per file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* Use system calls only when you need to (why?)
* Write a README with the description of your project
* You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. Format, see Docker
